# Genetic Algorithm for traversing a maze

- The DNA script is responsible for rotating in any of the 360 degrees on seeing a wall or moving forward when nothing is infront
- The Brain script contains the ray tracing logic to check if a wall is in front and is also responsible for carrying out the functionality of the DNA class
- The spawn manager has logic for maximising the distance moved and combining the previous generation to get the current generation.
